# Inventory Optimisation

## Introduction

What is Uncertainty?

Making decisions under imperfect or unknown information

![https://medialibrarycdn.blueyonder.com/-/media/images/blue yonder/master/petal hero images/inventory_hero.jpg?h=1080&iar=0&w=1920&rev=-1](https://medialibrarycdn.blueyonder.com/-/media/images/blue yonder/master/petal hero images/inventory_hero.jpg?h=1080&iar=0&w=1920&rev=-1)

## **Uncertainty in Supply Chain**

1. Demand Uncertainty (Will Customers Buy - As Forecasted)
2. Supply Uncertainty (Supplier be on Time - For Delivery)
3. Production Uncertainty (Enough Production Capacity - Production)

Managing a supply chain involves making decisions under imperfect or unknown information. Uncertainty in the supply chain can arise from various sources, including demand uncertainty, supply uncertainty, and production uncertainty. Addressing these challenges requires finding the right balance between service level, stock holding, and safety stock.

Demand Uncertainty
Demand uncertainty refers to the risk of customers not buying products as forecasted. This can be due to factors such as changing consumer preferences, unexpected events, and economic conditions. When demand is uncertain, companies need to hold safety stock to buffer against unexpected fluctuations.
Demand uncertainty can be further categorized into smooth vs. volatile demand. Smooth demand occurs when the forecasted volume is close to the actual demand, requiring a smaller safety stock to maintain the same service level. In contrast, volatile demand occurs when the forecasted volume is often far from the actual demand, requiring a larger safety stock to maintain the same service level.

Supply Uncertainty
Supply uncertainty refers to the risk of suppliers not delivering goods on time. This can be due to factors such as geopolitical events, last-minute orders, transportation delays, weather conditions, vehicle breakdowns, driver shortages, and trade barriers. When suppliers are unreliable, companies need to hold more safety stock to ensure that they can meet customer demand in case of unexpected delays.
Supplier reliability is another factor that affects safety stock. When suppliers are reliable and deliver goods on time, companies can hold smaller safety stock. In contrast, when suppliers are unreliable and frequently deliver goods late, companies need to hold larger safety stock to ensure that they can meet customer demand in case of unexpected delays.

Production Uncertainty
Production uncertainty refers to the risk of not having enough production capacity to meet demand. This can be due to factors such as raw material shortages, production defects, maintenance, strikes, energy costs, labor shortages, and machine breakdowns. When production is unreliable, companies need to hold more safety stock to ensure that they can meet customer demand in case of unexpected shortages.
Lead times also affect safety stock. When lead times are shorter, companies can hold smaller safety stock. In contrast, when lead times are longer, companies need to hold larger safety stock to ensure that they can meet customer demand in case of unexpected delays.
In summary, managing uncertainty in the supply chain requires finding the right balance between service level, stock holding, and safety stock. This involves analyzing historic forecast errors and the volatility of demand, assessing supplier and production reliability, and considering lead times. By doing so, companies can optimize their inventory management and ensure that they have enough inventory on hand to meet customer demand while minimizing the risk of stockouts.

## Stockouts

Stockouts refer to a situation where a company has run out of a particular item that is in demand from customers. In inventory management, stockouts are considered undesirable as they result in lost sales and dissatisfied customers. Effective inventory management involves forecasting demand, managing inventory levels, and ensuring timely replenishment of stock to avoid stockouts.

## Addressing These Challenges.

A Late Delivery from supplier causes Stockout for Days. (Safety Stock is additional stock as a buffer)

How much is needed?

Optimal Stock Level:

Too Little: Stock outs (Understocked)
Just Right: Balance service level and stock holding to maximize monetary KPI (Well Stocked)
Too Much: Unnecessary capital tied up + storage costs (perishability is a bigger problem) (Over Stocked)

SKU Demand  - Easy To Forecast / Difficult

SKU Delivery - on Time / Late

SKU Last - Forever / Short Shell Life

SKU Specific - Uncertainty with demand (High)

Demand Uncertainty

Smooth vs. Volatile (More Uncertainty - Greater Safety Stock Needed to Hold)
Smooth: When the forecasted volume is close to the actual demand, holding a safety stock (SS) is required to achieve the same service level.
Volatile: When the forecasted volume is often far from the actual demand, holding a greater safety stock (SS) is required to achieve the same service level.

Supply Uncertainty 

On-Time Delivery vs Late Delivery (More Uncertainty Requires Greater Safety Stock)
If a supplier is reliable and delivers on time, a small safety stock is needed. However, if a supplier is unreliable and delivers late, a large safety stock is necessary.

Production Uncertainty

Production Reliable (Clock Work) should be replaced with Small SS.
Production Unreliable (Out of Action) should be replaced with Large SS.

Raw Material Shortage / Production Defects / Maintenance / Strikes / Energy Costs / Labour Shortage / Machine Breaks Down

Lead Times Uncertainty

Review Period Frequency and Stock Holding
When the review period of a supply chain is shorter, less stock needs to be held. Conversely, when the review period is longer, more stock needs to be held.
Lead Time Comparisons
Short lead time between the reorder date and delivery date results in a small safety stock (SS). In contrast, a long lead time between the reorder date and delivery date results in a large safety stock.
Service Level Comparisons
To cover against an increase of outlier events, increase the target service level (and therefore the safety stock) in the supply chain. This will impact each component in a distinct way.

## Safety Stock  :

Safety stock is a quantity of inventory that a company holds to buffer against unexpected demand or supply chain disruptions. Calculating safety stock is an important aspect of inventory management, as it helps ensure that a company has enough inventory on hand to meet customer demand while minimizing the risk of stockouts.

![https://abcsupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eoq-formula-safety-stock-1.png](https://abcsupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eoq-formula-safety-stock-1.png)

### Assuming the Forecast Error Distribution is a Normal Distribution then Safety Stock is calculated as follows :

There are various ways to calculate safety stock by using the historical forecast error / or demand data to estimate the variability of demand. If the forecast errors / demand is normally distributed, which is often assumed in inventory management, then the standard deviation of the forecast error / demand can be used to calculate the safety stock.

![Screenshot 2023-03-18 at 9.31.55 PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/227dab48-a1fc-4bd0-83ed-57a13230352c/Screenshot_2023-03-18_at_9.31.55_PM.png)

The following formulas can be used

1. Average - Max Method :

`Safety Stock  =  (lead_time_max * demand_max)-(lead_time_avg * demand_avg)`

2. Heizer and Render Method :

`Safety Stock  = z_score * demand_sd * sqrt(lead_time_avg)`

3. Greasley's Method :

`Safety Stock  = z_score * demand_avg * lead_time_sd`

4. King's Method :

`Safety Stock  = z_score * (sqrt(lead_time_avg*(demand_sd)**2 + ((demand_avg)**2 * (lead_time_sd**2))))`

5. Alternative Method :

`Safety Stock  = (z_score * demand_sd * sqrt(lead_time_avg))+ (z_score * demand_avg * lead_time_sd)`

Here, z_score is computed as follows : (As the normal distribution is symmetric in nature we need to tweak the formula to account for both the tails.) `z_score <- qnorm(service_level + ((1 - service_level) / 2))`

z_score is the number of standard deviations required to achieve the desired service level.

qnorm or ppf : ** Probability Point Function**`(or Inverse Cumulative Distribution Function)

The graph on the left denotes that for a given x value the respective cdf(x) value is input to the ppf function, and ppf returns once again the original x value.

```python
>>> import scipy.stats as st
>>> st.norm.ppf(.95)
1.6448536269514722
>>> st.norm.cdf(1.64)
0.94949741652589625
```

This formula calculates the stock level needed to maintain a certain service level. It multiplies the Z-score of the service level by the standard deviation of demand.

SKU Last and SKU Specific are two factors that increase demand uncertainty, and therefore require a higher safety stock. Additionally, increasing the target service level will also require a larger safety stock to cover against outlier events. When calculating the appropriate safety stock size, it's important to consider historic forecast errors and the volatility of demand. This can be done by analyzing the forecast error distribution and using the KDE method to create a smooth curve, which is then converted into percentiles to determine the corresponding safety stock.

### Assuming the Forecast Error Distribution is not Normally Distributed then Safety Stock is calculated as follows : (Real World Cases)

### Non-parametric method

When forecast errors are not normally distributed, using the standard deviation to calculate safety stock may not be appropriate. In such cases, we can use a `non-parametric method`, such as kernel density estimation (KDE), to estimate the probability density function of the forecast errors and then use this distribution to calculate safety stock.

KDE is a method that estimates the probability density function of a random variable based on a set of observations. It works by placing a `Kernel`, which is a probability density function, at each observation and then summing the kernels to obtain an estimate of the underlying density function.

### Parametric method

### Assuming the Forecast Error Distribution is not Normally Distributed then Safety Stock is calculated as follows : (Real World Cases)

The GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model is a popular time-series model used for estimating volatility and forecasting future values of a time series. It can also be used to estimate the standard deviation of forecast errors for safety stock calculation.

Note that the GARCH model is a more complex and computationally intensive method compared to the other methods, but it can provide more accurate estimates of the standard deviation of forecast errors, especially for non-normally distributed data.

## Reorder Point

![https://abcsupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/safety-stock-reorder-point-eoq-1024x488.png](https://abcsupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/safety-stock-reorder-point-eoq-1024x488.png)

`ROP = Average Demand + Safety Stock`

ROP stands for Reorder Point, and it is the inventory level at which an order needs to be placed to avoid a stockout. The Safety Stock is added to the average demand to determine the ROP. The Safety Stock acts as a buffer against demand and supply uncertainties, ensuring that there is enough inventory to meet customer demand in case of unexpected fluctuations. A higher Safety Stock will result in a higher ROP, which means that orders will need to be placed more frequently to maintain inventory levels.

## Min Max Levels

If your stock drops below this point then you need to reorder more so you’re not at risk of stocking out.

`Min Level = ROP`

Max Level is the order up to amount. Order enough stock so that you’ll have enough net stock

`Max Level = Forecast Demand in Review Period + Min Level` 

![https://frepple.com/wp-content/uploads/computing-a-safety-stock-3.png](https://frepple.com/wp-content/uploads/computing-a-safety-stock-3.png)

Safety stocks aren’t an absolute protection against stockouts. A safety stock is always a balance between the risk and impact of a stockout and the cost of the extra safety stock inventory.The service level captures this balance. The service level is the percentage of the demand quantity you will be able to honor from your inventory.

For critical items, you want to be more than 99.x% sure you have them on stock when a demand comes in.

For a less critical items, you can can accept a stockout risk that is be considerably higher. Either the customer will wait during a temporary stockout, either you accept missing a small part of sales.

A ABC or ABC-XYZ analysis of your products is very common to choose an appropriate service level.  The picture below shows an example of such a matrix. The matrix varies greatly by industry and company: a supermarket will operate with a completely different set of rules and objects than a spare parts warehouse or a industrial equipment manufacturer.
